          Each person carries a set of{" "}
          <strong>personal stories about who they are.</strong> Usually these
          stories are shaped by powerful moments and past experiences. Over
          time, these stories can begin to define what we believe we're capable
          of, often leading to patterns that feel limiting or stuck. In
          individual therapy, I work collaboratively with clients to{" "}
          <strong>identify these recurring “frequent flyer” stories,</strong>{" "}
          understand how they react to them, and{" "}
          <strong>
            develop skills to respond in ways that reflect their values
          </strong>{" "}
          and what kind of person they strive to be. Together, we create space
          for{" "}
          <strong>
            greater self-awareness, flexibility, and a more empowered way of
            living.

          Every couple has a familiar “dance” during conflict—often a cycle
          where one partner criticizes, the other defends or counter-attacks,
          and eventually someone withdraws or shuts down. In couple therapy, one
          of <strong>the first steps is recognizing this dance,</strong>{" "}
          learning to pause, and listening for the music underneath—the
          emotions, needs, and longings that drive it. Together, we work to{" "}
          <strong>co-create new patterns of interaction</strong> that help you
          move more intentionally and in sync with one another. These new
          patterns are particularly important as couples go through life
          transitions--making a long-term commitment to each other, parenthood,
          midlife demands of parenting and caregiving, becoming grandparents,
          retirement, and aging. Sessions focus on deepening understanding,
          improving communication, and strengthening both partners’ ability to
          navigate conflict together. At the core of the work is a commitment to
          building a partnership rooted in{" "}
          <strong>gratitude, compassion, and connection.</strong>

          <strong>
            Family conflict is rarely just about individual disagreements
          </strong>
          —it is rooted in the broader systems and intergenerational patterns
          that shape each family member's experience. Families are dynamic and
          ever-evolving, much like the seasons. Family tension often arises
          during natural transitions—such as adolescents becoming adults, adult
          children stepping into parenting roles, or major life changes like
          chronic illness or loss affecting the family system. These periods
          call for shifts in roles and expectations, which can sometimes be met
          with resistance or difficulty. When families struggle to adapt, one or
          more members may feel unseen, misunderstood, or even oppressed. In
          family therapy, I help families navigate these challenges by
          identifying patterns across generations, clarifying individual needs,
          and fostering more effective and compassionate ways of relating.
          Together, we explore how shifts in one part of the system can create
          ripple effects throughout the family. This work is about more than
          resolving conflict, it's about{" "}
          <strong>
            helping each member feel more connected, understood, and empowered.
          </strong>{" "}
          My approach supports the well-being of both individuals and the family
          unit as a whole, while acknowledging the larger social, cultural, and
          relational systems in which they live.
